# ReverseEngineering


Here are my solutions to various crackmes that I've gathered . I've taken on this challenge purely for fun and learning purposes, documenting my progress as thoroughly as possible.

To keep things organized, I've categorized them into folders based on their sources. If you have additional crackmes to share, feel free to reach out to me.

It's important to note that the notes accompanying each crackme may not follow a strict sequential or chronological order. They've been added as I've explored and identified different functions or features. Reverse engineering involves scrutinizing the code multiple times in various ways, and not everything becomes apparent simultaneously.

These solutions reflect my learning journey, so there's a possibility of errors in terms of concepts, procedures, or even code interpretation. Consider them as guides, and I welcome your comments or corrections if you find anything amiss.

I'll be gradually adding more crackmes as time permits. The frequency of updates depends on the availability of time.

# Tools
I use Ghidra https://ghidra-sre.org/, and for dynamic analysis. I am working on a virtual machine ubuntu. 

# Credit
I got inspired by GabiMartin to document my journey in reverse engineering

# Notice

Always use a virtual machine when working with crackmes.

I will try to show solutions without spoiling the crackme
